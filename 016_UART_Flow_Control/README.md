An improved UART module with hardware flow control (utilising cts and rts channels) utilising queue structure; interrupt driven as opposed to polling

The main file is a simple demo program which reads some data and echoes it

Required hardware: UART-TTL converter exposing CTS and RTS pins

Required software: for linux it's unix `screen` program
