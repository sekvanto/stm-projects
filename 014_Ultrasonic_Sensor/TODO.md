I tried to utilize TIM2 CH2 instead of TIM1 CH1 for Input Capture, but neither configuration was successful. 
CLK register works as expected, ranging between 0...9999 and auto reloading.
But CCR1 and CCR2 (capture/compare registers) don't save TimeStamps - they always contain Zero.
This is a reminder for me in the future to fix it.

TODO: Make it work, now it doesn't
